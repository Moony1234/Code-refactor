# Code-refactor
## Added Features
Actually, I have added some features to the websites.
- I have added a navbar menu when the web is going to use on mobile devices or tablets,
  it will show an icon of the title headers. 
- I have added a hover color to the title headers in the navbar menu.
- The code has been written as semantic: Header, nav, section, article, h, paragraph, footer, etc.
- The code has been organized, decreased lines, and made, cleaned changed, and ordered 
  list to follow the work step by step to make it understandable for all.
- Comments have been added to the code to make all points clear, and much more.
